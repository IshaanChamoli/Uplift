# Uplift

# Inspiration
A new viral trend on social media short videos is recordings of text messages aided by an app to "pick someone up" or flirt with them. Our group found this concept to be interesting, but more useful and applicable in a different context: helping our friends when they are going through a challenging time. We all have faced situations where we had to be there for a friend but were unsure about what exactly to say. How can we support our friends no matter what? This inspired us to create an app that helps with exactly that.

# What it does
With Uplift, you can take advantage of AI to help craft the best response to a friend to be there for them in the best way possible. We have a simple easy-to-use user interface through which the user can provide our app a little more context into what the friend is facing, how the user wants to address the issue, and more information. We feed this data into AI and provide a list of sample responses that the user can respond with or take inspiration from, which can be copied directly from our app.

# How we built it
We used Penpot to build the wireframe, React Native to build the UI, and LangChain API and Open AI API to process the user situations and return sample responses. We also tried to implement Tesseract JS for optical character recognition from an image.


In exploring mental health resources, we found most apps require payment in return for professional services or untrained user volunteers, which is not an entirely viable solution. Therefore, we want to fill this niche in mental health services on a larger scale by utilizing the expert element that AI brings along with the human perspective from users and volunteers who personalize conversation.
